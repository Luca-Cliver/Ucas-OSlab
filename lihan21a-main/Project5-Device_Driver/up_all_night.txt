Up All Night - Hinder
Composed by Austin WinklerCody HansonBrian Howes
Saw a waitress couldn't waste it
Opportunity knocks and you take it
Went to my place gotta get a taste
Couple shots hit the bong we were wasted
Now she's all in the room is spinnin'
Probably shouldn't have shot that Jamison
Here we go again she's a perfect
Just tell me how I was in the mornin'
The night's far from over
And I'm far from sober
But she's lookin' fine
We're gonna be up all night
Gonna take you for a ride
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Get it on 'til the morning light
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Doin' things your Dad won't like
So far from sober that I'll have to slam
Through my hang over
Hey
We're goin' all night
Hey
Got my attention when she walked in
Turnin' heads with a tiny skirt and sassy grin
She's a blonde one they say they're more fun
I'll let you know when the sexy dirty deed is done
The night's far from over
And I'm far from sober
But she's lookin' fine
We're gonna be up all night
Gonna take you for a ride
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Get it on 'til the morning light
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Doin' things your Dad won't like
So far from sober that I'll have to slam
Through my hang over
Yeah yeah

Hell yeah

Probably shouldn't have shot that Jamison
Here we go again she's a perfect
Just tell me how I was in the mornin'
The night's far from over
And I'm far from sober
But she's lookin' fine
We're gonna be up all night
Gonna take you for a ride
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Get it on 'til the morning light
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Doin' things your Dad won't like
So far from sober that I'll have to slam
Through my hang over
Hey
We're goin' all night
Hey
Got my attention when she walked in
Turnin' heads with a tiny skirt and sassy grin
She's a blonde one they say they're more fun
I'll let you know when the sexy dirty deed is done
The night's far from over
And I'm far from sober
But she's lookin' fine
We're gonna be up all night
Gonna take you for a ride
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Get it on 'til the morning light
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Doin' things your Dad won't like
So far from sober that I'll have to slam
Through my hang over
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Hell yeah
Aw no no no
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Hell yeah
Aw no no no
Up All Night - Hinder
Composed by Austin WinklerCody HansonBrian Howes
Saw a waitress couldn't waste it
Opportunity knocks and you take it
Went to my place gotta get a taste
Couple shots hit the bong we were wasted
Now she's all in the room is spinnin'
Probably shouldn't have shot that Jamison
Here we go again she's a perfect
Just tell me how I was in the mornin'
The night's far from over
And I'm far from sober
But she's lookin' fine
We're gonna be up all night
Gonna take you for a ride
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
Get it on 'til the morning light
Yeah we're gonna be up all night
